# üçÑ ML Mushroom Pipeline

The **ML Mushroom Pipeline** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a mushroom is **poisonous or edible** based on its physical features (such as color, odor, and cap shape).  

It combines **data preprocessing, model training, and visualization** into a single workflow.

## üì¶ Environment Setup

This project uses **Miniconda** for environment and dependency management, as well as **PyCharm** from JetBrains as IDE.
- Miniconda install link: https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
- PyCharm install link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/download-thanks.html?platform=windows

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the environment

Make sure you have **conda** installed, then go to:
```bash
cd ml-mushroom-pipeline
```
Then run:
```conda
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the environment

```bash
conda activate ml-mushroom-pipeline
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify installation

```bash
conda list
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set the environment as default in PyCharm (Windows)

To make sure PyCharm always uses your **`ml-mushroom-pipeline`** Conda environment by default:

1. Open your project in **PyCharm** (make sure `.idea/` is in your project root).
2. Go to: File ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Interpreter
3. Click: Add Interpreter ‚Üí Add Local Interpreter
4. Choose: Select existing ‚Üí Type:Conda
5. In the path field, browse to your Conda environment‚Äôs Python executable, usually found at:
```bash
C:\Users\<your_user>\miniconda3\envs\ml-mushroom-pipeline\python.exe
```
6. Click OK, then Apply.

PyCharm will now use this environment automatically for:
- Running scripts (`Shift + F10`)
- Using the built-in terminal
- Running tests and notebooks

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm it‚Äôs active in PyCharm

- Look in the bottom-right corner of PyCharm ‚Äî it should say: ml-mushroom-pipeline

- You can also open PyCharm‚Äôs terminal (`View ‚Üí Tool Windows ‚Üí Terminal`) and run:
```bash
conda info --envs
```
