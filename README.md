# 🍄 ML Mushroom Pipeline

The **ML Mushroom Pipeline** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a mushroom is **poisonous or edible** based on its physical features (such as color, odor, and cap shape).  

It combines **data preprocessing, model training, and visualization** into a single workflow.
